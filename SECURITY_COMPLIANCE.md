# Security & Compliance Plan
## Healthcare Query System - HIPAA Compliance & FHIR Security

### Executive Summary

This document outlines the security and compliance strategy for the Healthcare Query System to ensure HIPAA compliance and secure handling of FHIR healthcare data. The system implements multiple layers of security controls, audit mechanisms, and access management to protect patient health information (PHI) and maintain regulatory compliance.

---

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

### OAuth 2.0 / SMART on FHIR Integration

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow**: Implement standard OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for secure authentication
- **SMART on FHIR Compliance**: Full integration with SMART on FHIR specification for healthcare app authorization
- **JWT Token Management**: Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) with secure refresh token rotation
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all healthcare provider accounts

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
# Example OAuth 2.0 integration
@app.middleware("http")
async def verify_smart_token(request: Request, call_next):
    if request.url.path.startswith("/api/"):
        token = extract_bearer_token(request)
        if not validate_smart_token(token):
            raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid or expired token")
    return await call_next(request)
```

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**User Roles & Permissions:**

1. **Healthcare Provider (Physician)**
   - Full access to patient queries within their practice
   - Can view all patient data for their assigned patients
   - Query logging and audit trail

2. **Healthcare Provider (Nurse)**
   - Limited access to basic patient information
   - Cannot access sensitive conditions (e.g., mental health, substance abuse)
   - Restricted to current shift patients

3. **Healthcare Administrator**
   - Aggregate data access only (no individual patient details)
   - System configuration and user management
   - Audit log review capabilities

4. **Research User**
   - De-identified data access only
   - Statistical queries without patient identifiers
   - Limited to approved research datasets

**Permission Matrix:**
```json
{
  "physician": {
    "patient_search": true,
    "condition_access": ["all"],
    "data_export": true,
    "audit_access": false
  },
  "nurse": {
    "patient_search": true,
    "condition_access": ["basic", "chronic"],
    "data_export": false,
    "audit_access": false
  },
  "admin": {
    "patient_search": false,
    "condition_access": [],
    "data_export": false,
    "audit_access": true,
    "user_management": true
  }
}
```

## 2. Data Privacy & Protection

### HIPAA Compliance Measures

**Technical Safeguards (45 CFR §164.312):**

1. **Access Control (§164.312(a))**
   - Unique user identification for each system user
   - Automatic logoff after 15 minutes of inactivity
   - Encryption of PHI data at rest and in transit

2. **Audit Controls (§164.312(b))**
   - Comprehensive logging of all PHI access attempts
   - Failed authentication attempt monitoring
   - Regular audit log reviews and anomaly detection

3. **Integrity (§164.312(c))**
   - Digital signatures for data integrity verification
   - Checksums for detecting unauthorized data modifications
   - Version control for all patient data changes

4. **Person or Entity Authentication (§164.312(d))**
   - Multi-factor authentication required
   - Biometric authentication for high-risk access
   - Regular password policy enforcement

5. **Transmission Security (§164.312(e))**
   - TLS 1.3 encryption for all data in transit
   - VPN requirements for remote access
   - End-to-end encryption for API communications

### Data Encryption Strategy

**At Rest:**
- AES-256 encryption for database storage
- Encrypted file systems for temporary data
- Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for key management

**In Transit:**
- TLS 1.3 for all HTTP communications
- Certificate pinning for API endpoints
- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) implementation

**Application Level:**
- Field-level encryption for sensitive data (SSN, phone numbers)
- Tokenization of patient identifiers
- Zero-knowledge architecture where possible

---

## 3. Audit Logging & Monitoring

### Comprehensive Audit Trail

**Logged Events:**
- All patient data access attempts (successful and failed)
- Query execution with parameters and results count
- User authentication events and session management
- System configuration changes
- Data export and sharing activities

**Audit Log Structure:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "user_id": "physician_123",
  "session_id": "sess_abc789",
  "event_type": "patient_query",
  "resource_accessed": "Patient/12345",
  "query_parameters": {
    "condition": "diabetes",
    "age_filter": {"min_age": 50}
  },
  "results_count": 15,
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
  "user_agent": "Healthcare-App/1.0",
  "risk_score": 2
}
```

### Real-time Monitoring

**Anomaly Detection:**
- Unusual access patterns (time, location, volume)
- Suspicious query combinations
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Data exfiltration indicators

**Alerting System:**
- Immediate alerts for high-risk activities
- Daily summaries for administrative review
- Integration with SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

---

## 4. API Security

### Input Validation & Sanitization

**Query Sanitization:**
```python
def sanitize_query(query: str) -> str:
    # Remove potential injection attempts
    sanitized = re.sub(r'[<>"\']', '', query)
    # Limit query length
    if len(sanitized) > 200:
        raise ValueError("Query too long")
    return sanitized
```

### Rate Limiting

**Implementation:**
- 100 requests per minute per user
- 1000 requests per hour per organization
- Progressive backoff for repeated violations

### CORS Configuration

**Security Headers:**
```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["https://healthcare-app.com"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET", "POST"],
    allow_headers=["Authorization", "Content-Type"]
)
```

---

## 5. Data Minimization & Purpose Limitation

### Query Result Filtering

**Automatic Data Reduction:**
- Return only necessary fields based on user role
- Implement result set limits (max 50 patients per query)
- Remove indirect identifiers when possible

**Purpose-Based Access:**
```python
def filter_results_by_purpose(results, user_role, query_purpose):
    if query_purpose == "research":
        return anonymize_results(results)
    elif query_purpose == "treatment" and user_role == "physician":
        return results  # Full access
    else:
        return filter_sensitive_data(results)
```

---

## 6. Incident Response Plan

### Security Incident Classification

**Severity Levels:**
1. **Critical**: Unauthorized PHI access, data breach
2. **High**: Authentication bypass, privilege escalation
3. **Medium**: Failed authentication patterns, unusual access
4. **Low**: Minor configuration issues, performance degradation

### Response Procedures

**Immediate Actions (0-4 hours):**
- Incident detection and classification
- Containment and system isolation if necessary
- Stakeholder notification (CISO, Privacy Officer)

**Investigation Phase (4-24 hours):**
- Forensic analysis of affected systems
- Scope determination and impact assessment
- Evidence collection and preservation

**Recovery & Lessons Learned (24-72 hours):**
