   ```

4. **"Show patients with asthma under 30"**
   ```json
   Input → Parameters: {
     "conditions": ["asthma"],
     "age_filter": {"max_age": 30}
   }
   FHIR Mapping → GET /Patient?condition=asthma&age=le30
   ```

5. **"Find heart disease patients"**
   ```json
   Input → Parameters: {
     "conditions": ["heart disease"]
   }
   FHIR Mapping → GET /Patient?condition=heart-disease
   ```
