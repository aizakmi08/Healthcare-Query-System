# Security & HIPAA Compliance Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures and HIPAA compliance strategies for the Healthcare Data Query System. The system is designed to handle Protected Health Information (PHI) securely while providing efficient access to authorized users.

## Authentication & Authorization

### SMART on FHIR Integration
- Implementation of SMART on FHIR authentication protocol
- OAuth 2.0 flow with OpenID Connect
- JWT-based token management with short expiration times
- Secure token storage and transmission

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
1. User Roles:
   - Administrator: Full system access
   - Physician: Read/write access to assigned patients
   - Nurse: Limited read access to assigned patients
   - Researcher: Anonymized data access only

2. Access Levels:
   - PHI Access: Requires specific role and purpose
   - Audit Trail Access: Limited to administrators
   - Configuration Access: Role-specific permissions

## Data Privacy & Security

### Data Encryption
1. In Transit:
   - TLS 1.3 for all API communications
   - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
   - Secure WebSocket connections for real-time updates

2. At Rest:
   - AES-256 encryption for stored PHI
   - Encrypted database backups
   - Secure key management system

### Data Handling
1. Minimization:
   - Collection of only necessary PHI
   - Automatic data anonymization where possible
   - Regular data purging based on retention policies

2. Access Controls:
   - IP-based access restrictions
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Session management with automatic timeouts

## Audit Logging

### Comprehensive Logging
1. Access Logs:
   - User authentication attempts
   - PHI access events
   - Search queries and results
   - Data modifications

2. System Logs:
   - API endpoint usage
   - Error events
   - System configuration changes
   - Performance metrics

### Audit Trail
- Immutable audit records
- Regular audit log reviews
- Automated alerting for suspicious activities
- Compliance reporting capabilities

## HIPAA Compliance Measures
